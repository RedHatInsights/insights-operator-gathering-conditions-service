# Description

Simple service that provides conditional gathering-related rules. Such rules
are read from JSON structures and made available via REST API.

## REST API

REST API is described by [OpenAPI specification](openapi.json).

# Usage

## Build

To build the service, install Go 1.20 or above and run:

```shell script
make build
```

## Configure

Configuration is done by `toml` config, taking the `config/config.toml` in the working directory if no configuration is provided. This can be overriden by `INSIGHTS_OPERATOR_CONDITIONAL_SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

## Conditions

First you need to clone the conditions repository and build it

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-operator-gathering-conditions
cd insights-operator-gathering-conditions
./build.sh
cp -r ./build ../conditions
```

or `make conditions`.

It will build the gathering conditions image.

## Run

To execute the service, run:

```shell script
./insights-operator-gathering-conditions-service
```

or:

```shell script
make run
```

Then you can test it:

```shell script
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/gathering/v1/gathering_rules | jq
```

There are some flags for different purposes:

- `bin/insights-conditions-service -show-configuration`: used to print the configuration in `stdout`.
- `bin/insights-conditions-service -show-authors`: used to print the authors of the repository.
- `bin/insights-conditions-service -show-version`: used to print the binary version including commit, branch and build time.

### Rapid recommendations

As part of [CCXDEV-12849](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-12849) we
introduced a new feature to map remote configurations to different OCP versions.

In order to use it you need to set the `cluster_mapping` and
`remote_configuration` fields in [config.toml] or use environment variables.
The cluster map should look like this:
```
[
	["1.0.0", "first.json"],
	["2.0.0", "second.json"],
	["3.0.0", "third.json"]
]
```
meaning clusters with versions between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 would receive first.json
, second.json for versions between 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 and third.json for versions
greater than 3.0.0.

Note that when major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has
lower precedence than a normal version. For example,
`4.17.6-0.ci-2024-08-19-220527` is lower than `4.17.6`.

Use `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/gathering/v2/4.17.0/gathering_rules` in
order to check this new endpoint.

## Makefile

There are many options inside the [Makefile](Makefile) that may be useful for debugging/deploying the service:

```
Usage: make <OPTIONS> ... <TARGETS>

Available targets are:

clean                Run go clean
build                Build binary containing service executable
fmt                  Run go fmt -w for all sources
lint                 Run golint
vet                  Run go vet. Report likely mistakes in source code
cyclo                Run gocyclo
ineffassign          Run ineffassign checker
shellcheck           Run shellcheck
errcheck             Run errcheck
goconst              Run goconst checker
gosec                Run gosec checker
abcgo                Run ABC metrics checker
openapi-check        Validate the OpenAPI specification files
conditions           Clone the conditions repo and build it to gather the conditions
check-config         Check all the configuration files are parsable
style                Run all the formatting related commands (fmt, vet, lint, cyclo) + check shell scripts
run                  Build the project and executes the binary
test                 Run the unit tests
integration_tests    Run all integration tests
before_commit        Checks done before commit
help                 Show this help screen
function_list        List all functions in generated binary file
container-build      Build the container image
container-run        Run the container image
```

## BDD tests

Behaviour tests for this service are included in [Insights Behavioral
Spec](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-behavioral-spec) repository.
In order to run these tests, the following steps need to be made:

1. clone the [Insights Behavioral Spec](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-behavioral-spec) repository
1. go into the cloned subdirectory `insights-behavioral-spec`
1. run the `aggregator_tests.sh` from this subdirectory

List of all test scenarios prepared for this service is available at
<https://redhatinsights.github.io/insights-behavioral-spec/feature_list.html#insights-operator-gathering-conditions-service>


# Container

To build the container you need to set up two environment variables:

1. `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` usually `docker` or `podman`
2. `CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME` the image name


then use the command:

```shell script
make container-build
```

Once build you can run it using:

```shell script
make container-run
```

Then you can test it:

```shell script
curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/gathering/gathering_rules | jq
```
