# Description

Simple service that provides conditional gathering-related rules. Such rules
are read from JSON structures and made available via REST API.

## REST API

REST API is described by [OpenAPI specification](openapi.json).

# Usage

## Build

To build the service locally, install Go 1.20 or above and run:

```shell script
make build
```

### As a container

To build the container you need to set up two environment variables:

1. `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` usually `docker` or `podman`
2. `CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME` the image name


then use the command:

```shell script
make container-build
```

Once build you can run it using:

```shell script
make container-run
```

Then you can test it:

```shell script
curl -s http://localhost:8081/api/gathering/gathering_rules | jq
```

## Configure

Configuration is done by `toml` config, taking the `config/config.toml` in the working directory if no other configuration is provided. This can be overriden by `INSIGHTS_OPERATOR_CONDITIONAL_SERVICE_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

You can also override specific configuration options by setting specific
environment variables in this form:
`INSIGHTS_OPERATOR_GATHERING_CONDITIONS_SERVICE__{table}__{key}`,
being the `table` and `key ` concepts defined in the [TOML specification](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#table).

For example, for a configuration like this

```
[storage]
remote_configuration = "./conditions/v2"
cluster_mapping = "cluster-mapping.json"
```

you would override these values as follows:

```
export INSIGHTS_OPERATOR_GATHERING_CONDITIONS_SERVICE__STORAGE__REMOTE_CONFIGURATION=tests/rapid-recommendations
export INSIGHTS_OPERATOR_GATHERING_CONDITIONS_SERVICE__STORAGE__CLUSTER_MAPPING=tests/rapid-recommendations/cluster-mapping.json
```

## Conditions

This service exposes the conditions from the
[insights-operator-gathering-conditions](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-operator-gathering-conditions)
repository as a REST API. First you need to clone that repository and build it using

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-operator-gathering-conditions
cd insights-operator-gathering-conditions
./build.sh
cp -r ./build ../conditions
```

or `make conditions`. This will create a set of folders under `conditions` with
the v1 remote configurations and the v2 rapid recommendations (also called
remote-configurations).

## Run

To execute the service, you have 3 alternatives:

- `./insights-operator-gathering-conditions-service`
- `make run`
- `make container-run` (as explained above)

Then you can test it using `curl`, for example:

```shell script
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/gathering/v1/gathering_rules | jq
```

### Flags

There are some flags for different purposes:

- `./insights-conditions-service -show-configuration`: used to print the configuration in `stdout`.
- `./insights-conditions-service -show-authors`: used to print the authors of the repository.
- `./insights-conditions-service -show-version`: used to print the binary version including commit, branch and build time.

### Rapid recommendations

As part of [CCXDEV-12849](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CCXDEV-12849) we
introduced a new feature to map remote configurations to different OCP versions.

In order to use it you need to set the `cluster_mapping` and
`remote_configuration` fields in [config.toml] or use environment variables.
The cluster map should look like this:
```
[
	["1.0.0", "first.json"],
	["2.0.0", "second.json"],
	["3.0.0", "third.json"]
]
```
meaning clusters with versions between 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 would receive first.json
, second.json for versions between 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 and third.json for versions
greater than 3.0.0.

Note that when major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has
lower precedence than a normal version. For example,
`4.17.6-0.ci-2024-08-19-220527` is lower than `4.17.6`.

Use `curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/gathering/v2/4.17.0/gathering_rules` in
order to check this new endpoint.

## Monitoring

The service exposes some metrics in the `/metrics` endpoint. Apart from the
default metrics, it also exposes the ones defined in
[metrics.go](internal/service/metrics.go).

All these metrics are then used in [Grafana](https://grafana.app-sre.devshift.net/d/gathering/ccx-gathering-service)

## Makefile

There are many options inside the [Makefile](Makefile) that may be useful for debugging/deploying the service:

```

## BDD tests

Behaviour tests for this service are included in [Insights Behavioral
Spec](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-behavioral-spec) repository.
In order to run these tests, the following steps need to be made:

1. clone the [Insights Behavioral Spec](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-behavioral-spec) repository
1. go into the cloned subdirectory `insights-behavioral-spec`
1. run the `aggregator_tests.sh` from this subdirectory

List of all test scenarios prepared for this service is available at
<https://redhatinsights.github.io/insights-behavioral-spec/feature_list.html#insights-operator-gathering-conditions-service>
